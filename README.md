# Customer-churn-prediction

customer churn is a key business problem where customers discontinue services, leading to revenue loss. This project builds a machine learning pipeline that:

Preprocesses the dataset: Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
Performs feature selection: Identifies key customer attributes influencing churn.
Trains multiple ML models: Evaluates different algorithms to find the best-performing one.
Visualizes results: Compares models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
